## Title

> Overcoming Failure

## Elevator Pitch
You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the "elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.

> Failure happens. It can be gut-wrenching, job-ending, or it can be… healthy. Through my own experiences, let’s unravel the stigma of failure. Let’s identify patterns in each situation to recognize the problem, and strategies to overcome failure when it happens.

## Description
The description will be seen by reviewers during the CFP process and may eventually be seen by the attendees of the event.

> Software projects fail. Our teams fail. We as individuals fail. It can tear us apart, or it can lead to something better.

> Through my own experiences, let’s explore the lifecycle of failure. In a series of three stories, we’ll see how projects unravel, and acknowledge the impact it can have on our team, our relationships, and our lives. To make this practical, we’ll identify the patterns that warn us of trouble, and explore strategies to mitigate and potentially avoid catastrophe. Ultimately, we’ll consider a work culture that defends against failure, but handles it readily when it eventually arrives.

You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.

## Notes
Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...

> I gave this talk in 2016 at a local conference, Develop Denver. I shared my personal history of failure, and how each one impacted my career, my relationships, and my life. I didn’t think it would be a big deal, but I was blown away by the feedback and thanks I received after the talk. It’s even lead to new work relationships and stronger connections in our community.

> The talk was powerful for two reasons: sharing personal stories of real life failure; and including the consequences of said failures. These consequences included getting fired, being hospitalized, and almost losing my family. To make this talk effective and actionable, I repeatedly identify patterns that indicate trouble, and strategies to improve the situation. The patterns are easy to relate to and the strategies widely applicable.

> I plan to revise the stories from five to three, but maintain the same approach and message.
