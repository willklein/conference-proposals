## Title

> An Introverts Guide to Public Speaking

## Elevator Pitch
You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the "elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.

> I grew up bullied and quiet, terrified of public speaking. Today, I organize a meetup and speak at conferences. It took lots of effort, and lots of failure. What does the journey look like? How does that make me a better developer? How do we help others overcome their own obstacles?

## Description
The description will be seen by reviewers during the CFP process and may eventually be seen by the attendees of the event.

> At a young age, I was bullied by other kids, and even after the abuse, I struggled to make friends, let alone speak in front of even small groups. Today, I organize a meetup and speak at conferences. People think I'm outgoing, a "people person." How did this happen? What does the journey look like? It took lots of effort, and lots of failure. This is the story of how I dealt with fear and anxiety, one step at a time. Most importantly, this is about how we help others overcome their own challenges and share their gifts with us.

You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.

## Notes
Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...

> I know so many people who have been taught they were less than others, that their voice did not matter. I felt this way myself for years. At 15, I was tired of feeling this way, and I took this head on. Still, it took over a decade to make my way into public speaking. It took even longer to feel any semblance of confidence and to shake the anxiety. I've seen others deal with the same issues, often with greater obstacles and greater courage.

> I encourage people who have never spoken before, to present at my meetup and to propose at conferences. I organized a Global Diversity CFP Day workshop for Denver. I do what I can locally, and I offer to mentor anyone around the world. I want this to change for more people though: that's what this talk is about for me. I hope that sharing my own story might inspire others. I want to give people a roadmap for how they can take each step and grow their voice as much as they want to. I want to tell every attendee that their voice matters, that they have unique gifts to share, and hopefully, help them take the next step.
