> Convention Tests: Linting at the Next Level

## Presentation Summary (to be used in the program)
Use plain text or Markdown. 3 to 5 sentences.

> Getting up to speed on a new project requires months of pairing, code review, and mentoring before we're comfortable on our own. Let’s fix this feedback loop and automate tribal knowledge by writing convention tests! Crafting our own linting rules seems daunting at first, but we’ll master the dark art together to realize how simple it really is.

## What else do you want to tell us about the talk?
Seen by the reviewers only (max. 500 chars)

> I learned this on my own and made this a first class tool at my previous company. We automated dozens of things that came up in code review, beyond what the traditional linting rules covered. I've taught this material at several meetups, and it keeps coming up whenever I join a new project. This talk introduces a core concept of modern tooling, the abstract syntax tree, and creates a path to understanding other tools like Babel.
