## Presentation Summary (to be used in the program)
Use plain text or Markdown. 3 to 5 sentences.

> Have you ever had an interview with technical trivia, intimidating code exercises, or heard of "culture fits?" As developers that interview (all of us!), we can do better! Whether it's crafting inclusive job descriptions, discovering personal goals, or identifying technical ability, let's learn best practices to reveal the best in every candidate. Most importantly, let's create an experience that gives everyone a chance to learn and walk away a better developer.

## What else do you want to tell us about the talk?
Seen by the reviewers only (max. 500 chars)

> I've seen a lot of bad job descriptions and intimidating interviews, and I want to stop bad practices that introduce bias and hurt our industry. I've also been on teams that cared deeply about doing better. They taught me skills and techniques to help candidates be more confident and effective. I've done this as a developer and as a manager, and believe everyone should know how to interview. No one teaches this, and while there are some books on the subject, there are very few talks.
