## Topic of Presentation
i.e. the title of the presentation

> Does our app still work? An intro to modern UI testing

## Presentation Summary (to be used in the program)
Use plain text or Markdown. 3 to 5 sentences.

> Without automated tests, you're letting your users test your app. It's time to up our game and improve software quality. Putting it together isn't trivial though, so let's discuss frontend testing inside and out. We'll differentiate unit vs integration tests, sort out mocks/stubs/spies, and learn how to be confident in every commit.

## What else do you want to tell us about the talk?
Seen by the reviewers only (max. 500 chars)

> People still think UI testing is too difficult. Let's change that. This is about clarifying the concepts and not specific to one library or tool. Fun fact: at my first JSConf five years ago, I had LOTS of questions on testing, and it's how I met the team who would teach me everything I know. This year I'm writing a book and putting together a workshop on the topic. I would love to bring this full-circle and present at JSConf EU.
